The template is built using HTML, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, and it doesn't use any CSS or JavaScript libraries or have any framework dependencies. Everyone is welcome to contribute or use it as a template for their portfolio. 

The menu & the buttons are almost identical to the ones from Natours Project of Jonas Schmedtmann [Advanced CSS & SASS course][course]. Many Thanks to him for such a great course.

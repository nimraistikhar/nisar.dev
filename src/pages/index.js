                    <p>I am a self-taught Frontend Web Developer from Lahore, Pakistan. About three years ago is when I started my learning journey on how to make the web stunning and responsive. I have always been a curious individual, which is why Iâ€™d love to collaborate and do some real-world projects in order to flourish my skills.I'm not perfect, however. I'm very far from perfection, yet I'm resilient, assertive and stubborn and I find learning a fascinating process. I am currently learning about PWAs and my future plan is to learn about ML for Web Performance.</p>

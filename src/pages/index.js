                    <p>
                        I am a self-taught front end developer and interface designer from Pakistan ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°. I was always curious about computers when I was a child I got introduced to programming in school. I dropped out from universty at the age of 18 with the grand plans of becoming a great computer scientist. I started my career as a front end web developer in 2019. I currently work for <a href="https://typefox.io" target="_blank">TypeFox</a> as a freelancer where entirety of the work i do is open source.
